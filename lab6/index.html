	<h1>Lab 6:Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<p>In this lab we staryed making arrays and know how to use them and to understand why they are useful. Also using objects to list things in java as well.</p>
	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	 	<p>Finding the java scrip link and making it work was a task,
			 Only small problem I had was neatly printing it using "console.log". Instead of using the "+" symbol, I replaced it with a comma which gave me a better looking print.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>Everything worked out as expected. I got my Javascirpt to appear at the bottom with no errors. </p>
